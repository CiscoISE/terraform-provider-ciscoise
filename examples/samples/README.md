# Samples

This directory contains examples that were run/tested manually via the Terraform CLI.

**WARNING**: If you run `terraform apply` on it may **change your own data**!! This applies to resources and some data sources that perform actions (for more check the data source documentation).

The samples use the provider assumming that you picked the option `Building it from source`. 

You can change it to use the registry version, for more information check the main [README](../../README.md).
