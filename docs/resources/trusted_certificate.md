  Usage
  Authentication within ISE
  Use
    "trustForIseAuth":true
     if the certificate is used for trust within ISE, such as for secure communication between ISE nodes
  Client authentication and Syslog
  Use
    "trustForClientAuth":true
     if the certificate is to be used for authentication of endpoints that contact ISE over the EAP protocol. Also check
    this box if certificate is used to trust a Syslog server. Make sure to have keyCertSign bit asserted under KeyUsage
    extension for this certificate.
    Note:
     "trustForClientAuth" can be set true only if the "trustForIseAuth" has been set true.
  Certificate based admin authentication
  Use
    "trustForCertificateBasedAdminAuth":true
     if the certificate is used for trust within ISE, such as for secure communication between ISE nodes
    Note:
     "trustForCertificateBasedAdminAuth" can be set true only if "trustForIseAuth" and "trustForClientAuth" are true.
  Authentication of Cisco Services
  Use
    "trustForCiscoServicesAuth":true
     if the certificate is to be used for trusting external Cisco services, such as Feed Service.
  OCSP Configuration
  Usage

  Use
    "rejectIfNoStatusFromOCSP":true
     to reject the certificate if the OCSP service returns UNKNOWN status
    Note:

    "rejectIfUnreachableFromOCSP":true
     to reject the certificate if the OCSP service is unreachable.
    Note:
     "rejectIfUnreachableFromOCSP:true" can be used only if "enableOCSPValidation" has been set true.
  Certificate Revocation List Configuration
  Usage
  Validation against CRL

    "downloadCRL":true
     to validate the certificate against CRL downloaded from URL mentioned in the field
    crlDistributionUrl
  CRL distribution url
  Use
    "crlDistributionUrl"
     to specify the URL from where the CRL should be downloaded
    Note:
     "crlDistributionUrl" value will only be used if "downloadCRL" has been set true.
  Retrieve CRL time
  Use
    "automaticCRLUpdate":true and automaticCRLUpdatePeriod, automaticCRLUpdatePeriod

    "nonAutomaticCRLUpdatePeriod, nonAutomaticCRLUpdateUnits
     to set the time period for CRL retrieval in loop.
  Note:
     All the above fields can be used only if "downloadCRL" has been set true.
  If download fails
  Use
    "crlDownloadFailureRetries" and "crlDownloadFailureRetriesUnits"
     to set retry time period if CRL download fails
    Note:
     "crlDownloadFailureRetries" and "crlDownloadFailureRetriesUnits" can be used only if "downloadCRL" has been set true.
  Enable Server Identity Check
  Use
    "enableServerIdentityCheck":true
     to verify that HTTPS or LDAPS server certificate name fits the configured server URL
    Note:
     "enableServerIdentityCheck:true" can be used only if "downloadCRL" has been set true.
  Bypass CRL Verification if CRL is not Received
  Use
    "authenticateBeforeCRLReceived":true
     to bypass CRL Verification if CRL is not Received
    Note:
     "authenticateBeforeCRLReceived:true" can be used only if "downloadCRL" has been set true.
