NOTE:
Request parameters accepting True and False as input can be replaced by 1 and 0 respectively.

~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco ISE, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco ISE workflow. It is executed in ISE without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ciscoise_trusted_certificate_import" "example" {
  provider = ciscoise
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
  parameters {
    allow_basic_constraint_cafalse         = "false"
    allow_out_of_date_cert                 = "false"
    allow_sha1_certificates                = "false"
    data                                   = "string"
    description                            = "string"
    name                                   = "string"
    trust_for_certificate_based_admin_auth = "false"
    trust_for_cisco_services_auth          = "false"
    trust_for_client_auth                  = "false"
    trust_for_ise_auth                     = "false"
    validate_certificate_extensions        = "false"
  }
}

output "ciscoise_trusted_certificate_import_example" {
  value = ciscoise_trusted_certificate_import.example
}
