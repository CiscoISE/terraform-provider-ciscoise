# ciscoise_node_group (Resource)

It manages create, read, update and delete operations on Node Group.

- This resource creates a node group in the cluster.  A node group is a group of PSNs, where the PSNs maintain a
heartbeat with each other. It is used primarily to terminate or transfer posture-pending sessions when a PSN in a local
node group fails.  Node group members can communicate over TCP/7800.


- Purpose of this API is to update an existing node group.


- Delete an existing node group in the cluster. Deleting the node group does not delete the nodes, but failover is no
longer carried out among the nodes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ciscoise_node_group" "example" {
  provider = ciscoise
  parameters {

    description = "string"
    mar_cache {

      query_attempts       = 1
      query_timeout        = 1
      replication_attempts = 1
      replication_timeout  = 1
    }
    name            = "string"
    node_group_name = "string"
  }
}

output "ciscoise_node_group_example" {
  value = ciscoise_node_group.example
}
```
