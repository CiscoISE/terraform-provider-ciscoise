# ciscoise_patch (Resource)

It manages create, read and delete operations on Patch.

- Triggers patch installation on the Cisco ISE node. A task ID is returned which can be used to monitor the progress of
the patch installation process. As the patch   installation triggers the Cisco ISE to restart, the task API becomes
unavailable for  a certain period of time.

- Triggers patch rollback on the Cisco ISE node. A task ID is returned which can be used to monitor the progress of the
patch rollback process. As the patch   rollback triggers the Cisco ISE to restart, the task API becomes unavailable for
a certain period of time.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ciscoise_patch" "example" {
  provider = ciscoise
  parameters {
    repository_name = "Workstation"
    patch_number    = 99
    patch_name      = "ise-patchbundle-3.1.0.518-Patch99-21093017.SPA.x86_64.tar.gz"
  }
}

output "ciscoise_patch_example" {
  value = ciscoise_patch.example
}
