# ciscoise Provider

The Cisco ISE provider is used to interact with Cisco Identity Services Engine APIs. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure provider with your  Cisco Identity Services Engine SDK credentials
provider "ciscoise" {
  #  Cisco Identity Services Engine user name
  username = "admin"
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_USERNAME

  #  Cisco Identity Services Engine password
  password = "admin123"
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_PASSWORD

  #  Cisco Identity Services Engine base URL, FQDN or IP
  base_url = "https://172.168.196.2"
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_BASE_URL

  # Boolean to enable debugging
  debug = "false"
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_DEBUG

  # Boolean to enable or disable SSL certificate verification
  ssl_verify = "false"
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_SSL_VERIFY

  # Boolean to enable or disable the usage of the ISE's API Gateway
  use_api_gateway = "false"
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_USE_API_GATEWAY

  # Boolean to enable or disable the usage of the X-CSRF-Token header
  use_csrf_token = "false"
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_USE_CSRF_TOKEN

  # Timeout (in seconds) for the RESTful HTTP requests
  single_request_timeout = 60
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_SINGLE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT

  # Boolean to enable or disable autoimport on resources
  enable_auto_import = "false"
  # it can be set using the environment variable ISE_ENABLE_AUTO_IMPORT
}

### Optional

- **base_url** (String) Identity Services Engine base URL, FQDN or IP. If not set, it uses the ISE_BASE_URL environment variable.
- **debug** (String) Flag for Identity Services Engine to enable debugging. If not set, it uses the ISE_DEBUG environment variable; defaults to `false`.
- **password** (String, Sensitive) Identity Services Engine password to authenticate. If not set, it uses the ISE_PASSWORD environment variable.
- **single_request_timeout** (Number) Timeout (in seconds) for the RESTful HTTP requests. If not set, it uses the ISE_SINGLE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT environment varible; defaults to 60.
- **ssl_verify** (String, Sensitive) Flag to enable or disable SSL certificate verification. If not set, it uses the ISE_SSL_VERIFY environment variable; defaults to `true`.
- **use_api_gateway** (String) Flag to enable or disable the usage of the ISE's API Gateway. If not set, it uses the ISE_USE_API_GATEWAY environment variable; defaults to `false`.
- **use_csrf_token** (String) Flag to enable or disable the usage of the X-CSRF-Token header. If not set, it uses the ISE_USE_CSRF_TOKEN environment varible; defaults to `false`.
- **username** (String, Sensitive) Identity Services Engine username to authenticate. If not set, it uses the ISE_USERNAME environment variable.
- **enable_auto_import** (String) Flag to enable or disable terraform automatic import (Automatic import means that when Terraform attempts to create the resource, it will perform a get operation if it founds a matching resource, it will perform an import of the resource it found, this is a similar operation to the terraform import command.) in resources, this is a configuration added to the provider, it uses the ISE_ENABLE_AUTO_IMPORT environment varible; `true` to enable it, defaults to `false`.
