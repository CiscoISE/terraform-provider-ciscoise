  It performs read operation on PAN HA.
  In a high availability configuration, the primary PAN is in active state. The secondary PAN (backup PAN) is in standby
  state, which means that it receives all the configuration updates from the primary PAN, but is not active in the Cisco
  ISE cluster. You can configure Cisco ISE to automatically promote the secondary PAN when the primary PAN becomes
