# ciscoise_pan_ha_update (Data Source)

It performs update operation on PAN HA.

- To deploy the auto-failover feature, you must have at least three nodes, where two of the nodes assume the
Administration persona, and one node acts as the health check node. A health check node is a non-administration node and
can be a Policy Service, Monitoring, or pxGrid node, or any combination of these. If the PANs are in different data
centers, you must have a health check node for each PAN.
 All the fields are mandatory to enable PanHA.
 Values of failedAttempts, pollingInterval, primaryHealthCheckNode, and secondaryHealthCheckNode are not considered when
the isEnable value is "false" in the request body.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ciscoise_pan_ha_update" "example" {
  provider         = ciscoise
  hostname         = "string"
  is_enabled       = "true"
  failed_attempts  = 5
  polling_interval = 120
  primary_health_check_node {
    hostname = "isenode"
  }
  secondary_health_check_node {
    hostname = "isenode"
  }
}
```
